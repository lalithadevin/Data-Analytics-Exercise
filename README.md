The four CSV files brands, users, receipts, and receipt items have several attibutes in which few are primary keys, foreign keys , and regular keys. In the attached hand-drawn image of relational database model pk stands for primary key and fk stands for foreign key.
Upon reviewing the excel files, the attributes were given datatypes int, float, varchar,text, date, and boolean based on their usage. The size for varchar datatypes is used until the highest size to store the largest possible barcode sequence number. 
The attributes which can be uniquely identified are defined as primary keys and the attributes referring to the primary key of other table are labelled as foreign keys.
The tables are joined based on these key references.
